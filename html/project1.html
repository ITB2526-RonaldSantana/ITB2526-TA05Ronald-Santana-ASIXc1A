                    <p>
                        This project consists of an automated attendance and class management system developed as both a
                        mobile
                        application and a responsive web platform. The system is designed to digitize and optimize the
                        attendance
                        process by allowing students to independently register their presence using their personal
                        devices, reducing
                        manual intervention and minimizing human error during class sessions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application includes a secure authentication system that ensures only authorized students
                        can mark
                        attendance. Attendance data is stored in a centralized database and updated in real time,
                        allowing students
                        to access detailed attendance records, view historical data, and monitor their participation
                        status throughout
                        the academic term. This promotes transparency and accountability while providing a reliable data
                        source for
                        academic tracking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to attendance tracking, the platform integrates a class content management module
                        that allows
                        teachers to upload, update, and manage lecture notes and learning materials live. Changes made
                        by teachers
                        are instantly synchronized across the mobile and web interfaces, ensuring that students always
                        have access
                        to the most up-to-date resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The teacher dashboard provides real-time control over attendance sessions, student records, and
                        shared content.
                        Through this interface, instructors can monitor attendance statistics, manage class data
                        efficiently, and
                        interact dynamically with students. The system's cross-platform architecture ensures
                        scalability, ease of
                        maintenance, and seamless user experience across different devices and operating systems.
