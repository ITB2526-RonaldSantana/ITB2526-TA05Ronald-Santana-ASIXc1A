                        This project is a task management application designed to help users efficiently organize and
                        track their
                        daily activities. The application allows for dynamic task creation, modification, and deletion,
                        providing
                        a responsive and intuitive interface that adapts instantly to user interactions without
                        requiring page
                        reloads.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The system is built with a focus on front-end interactivity and state management, ensuring that
                        task data
                        is updated in real time as users add or remove items. Each task can be marked as completed,
                        allowing users
                        to visually distinguish between pending and finished tasks, improving productivity and task
                        clarity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application architecture emphasizes clean code structure and scalability, making it easy to
                        extend with
                        additional features such as persistent storage, task prioritization, or category filtering. This
                        project
                        demonstrates core concepts of modern web development, including DOM manipulation, event
                        handling, and
                        user-centered interface design.
